# Vanilla Query

A syntax-conversion for Vanilla JS & CSS3 methods using traditional jQuery conventions.

Warning: This is NOT a replacement for jQuery. It is still recommended to use jQuery if your app uses plugins and/or makes extensive use of its methods/selectors.

Use this lib if you're relying strictly in Vanilla JS or you are only using jQuery to bind events and use simple selectors, for example in a [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) app.


### Scope

This is a strict Vanilla JS or CSS3 syntax conversion. No extra functionality is added - if some function is not available as Vanilla JavaScript or a CSS attribute it will not be created from scratch.


## Install

Using npm:
```
npm install vanilla-query
````

## Usage

Vanilla query will ovewrite the ```$``` namespace, so it is not recommended to be used along side jQuery, Zepto or other libs that may use that global variable.

Having said that, including it as a js dependency in your app should be enough to use the ```$``` methods as accustomed.
